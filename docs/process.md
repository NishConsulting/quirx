# Process

## Leadership

For Team NISH, authority, responsibility, and accountability for project quality was the purview of the project manager.

We assigned a product manager for Qui℞ prototype. The primary responsibility of the product manager was Qui℞ prototype health. Throughout the development of Qui℞ prototype, our product manager ensured that everyone was heard and all roadblocks were communicated as early as possible. They gathered questions from the development team and retrieved answers from the client, f18.
