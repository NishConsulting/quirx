# Process

## Leadership

For Team NISH, authority, responsibility, and accountability for project quality was the purview of the project manager.

We assigned a product manager for Qui℞ prototype. The primary responsibility of the product manager was Qui℞ prototype health. Throughout the development of Qui℞ prototype, our product manager ensured that everyone was heard and all roadblocks were communicated as early as possible. They gathered questions from the development team and retrieved answers from the client, f18.

## Team

We assembled a multidisciplinary team comprised of [Mukesh Dalal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdalal) as Product Manager, [Brian Dunn](http://hashrocket.com/team/brian-dunn) and [Dillon Hafer](https://www.dillonhafer.com/about) as developers.

The development pair shared full-stack responsibilities, including:

* Technical Architect
* Frontend Web Developer
* Backend Web Developer
* DevOps Engineer

## Project tracker

We are using [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1370420) to manage this project.

## Monitoring

We are using [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com) to continuously monitor this project's performance. Currently this only covers the performance of the prototype API layer. We developed, but have not implemented, a strategy to include the frontend asset serving in our monitoring.
